<p>
Acoording to variable class <b>various types of graphics</b> are suggested. You can select <b>one</b> or <b>several</b> of them (in this latter case the various types of representations will be superposed).
</p>

<p>All graphics correspond to package ggplot2's "geom" functions:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>geom_bar</b> displays bars, with height proportional to the number of cases in each group.</li>
<li><b>geom_bin2d</b> displays rectangular bins (heatmap of 2d bin counts).</li>
<li><b>geom_boxplot</b> displays box and whiskers plot. The upper whisker extends from the hinge to the highest value that is within 1.5 * IQR of the hinge, where IQR is the inter-quartile range, or distance between the first and third quartiles. The lower whisker extends from the hinge to the lowest value within 1.5 * IQR of the hinge. Data beyond the end of the whiskers are outliers and plotted as points (as specified by Tukey).</li>
<li><b>geom_density</b> displays a smooth kernel density estimate.</li>
<li><b>geom_density2d</b> displays contours from a 2d density estimate (2D kernel density estimation using kde2d).</li>
<li><b>geom_freqpoly</b> displays frequency polygons. Uses lines to display a 1d distribution by dividing into bins and counting the number of observations in each bin.</li>
<li><b>geom_histogram</b> displays a histogram. Uses bars to display a 1d distribution by dividing into bins and counting the number of observations in each bin.</li>
<li><b>geom_hex</b> displays hexagonal bins (heatmap of 2d bin counts).</li>
<li><b>geom_jitter</b> displays points, jittered to reduce overplotting.</li>
<li><b>geom_point</b> displays points, as for a scatterplot.</li>
<li><b>geom_rug</b> displays marginal rug plots.</li>
<li><b>geom_smooth</b>: displays smooth of y=f(x), and 95% confidence intervals around smooth. For datasets with n < 1000 the smoothing method is loess. For datasets with n &#8805 1000 or more observations the smoothing method is a generalized additive model (GAM).</li>
<li><b>geom_violin</b> displays a violin plot.</li>

</ul>
